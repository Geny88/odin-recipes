    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">
        There is a chef in Rome who developed a brilliant technique for cooking Spaghetti alla Carbonara. His name is Luciano Monosilio and he is known as, “The King of Carbonara”. I studied his technique, translated and adapted his recipe so that we can enjoy perfect carbonara without any hassle. This is one of my new favorite cooking techniques for pasta, I believe it's as close to fool-proof as a traditional Italian pasta can be. Here's how to make it.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 Pound Pancetta/Guanciale, cut into thick cubes</li>
        <li>4 Tablespoon of Rendered Pancetta/Guanciale Fat</li>
        <li>Reserved Pasta Water</li>
        <li>One Big Pinch of Salt (for pasta water)</li>
    </ul>
